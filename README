OSX has a bad habit of cluttering up USB drives.
This script cleans and ejects the given volume.
I use it to eject my drive every time, so I keep it in /usr/local/bin/

Usage:
$ cleanusb <drive-name>

This should rm .Trashes/* .Spotlight/* and a lot of other weird clutter added.
Take a good look at the rm line before runnning this yourself,
you might end up deleting some hidden files that you created on purpose.
